# Learning Kubernetes Deployment Framework

After learning *Docker Swarm mode*, I came to the conclusion that it has great potential, but not ready yet as a product.

Kubernetes seems like a non-native feature that has existed for a much longer time and has a lot of followers.

It is thought to be more complex but also more configurable that *Docker Swarm mode*.
