# A advanced GKE cluster using Terraform

In `gke` directory, we have a pretty minimal GKE cluster. This project tries to use *everything* Terraform has to offer.

Possible features:

- Use Terraform modules
- Use Terragrunt (remote state + state locking)
- Automate most of the `automation.md` tasks
- Handle IAM
- Handle DNS
