# Lab 1 Overview: How do I create a Kubernetes cluster and how do I maintain it?

In this lab, we'll go from absolute zero to having a bare Kubernetes installation. In [the next lab](/labs/lab2/overview.md), we'll prepare that cluster for production, before actually using it to deploy our applications [in the third lab](/labs/lab3/overview.md).
