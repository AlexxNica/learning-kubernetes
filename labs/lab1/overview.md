# Lab 1 overview: How do I create a Kubernetes cluster and how do I maintain it?

In this first lab, we'll go from absolute zero to having a bare Kubernetes installation. In [the next lab](/labs/lab2/overview.md), we'll prepare that cluster for production, and [in the third lab](/labs/lab3/overview.md) we'll use the cluster to deploy several generic and custom apps.

## Lab 1 overview

In the first part of the lab, we'll use [Terraform](/) as a tool for declaratively interacting with a cloud provider.

In the second part of the lab, we'll review situations in which you will want to upgrade your cluster, and how to go about it.

In the third part of the lab, we'll tell you how to destroy your cluster (useful for testing to avoid wasting money).
