# Lab 1: How do I create a Kubernetes cluster and how do I maintain it?

In this first lab, we'll go from absolute zero to having a bare Kubernetes installation. In [the next lab](/labs/lab2/overview.md), we'll prepare that cluster for production, and [in the third lab](/labs/lab3/overview.md) we'll use the cluster to deploy several generic and custom apps.

## Overview

In the first part of the lab, we'll use [Terraform](/) as a tool for declaratively creating a Kubernetes cluster. [Create a Kubernetes cluster](/labs/lab1/create-cluster.md)

In the second part of the lab, we'll review situations in which you will want to upgrade your cluster, and how to go about it. [Upgrade a Kubernetes cluster](/labs/lab1/upgrade-cluster.md)

In the third part of the lab, we'll tell you how to destroy your cluster (useful for testing to avoid wasting money). [Destroy a Kubernetes cluster](/labs/lab1/destroy-cluster.md)
