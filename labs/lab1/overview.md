# Lab 1 Overview: How do I create a Kubernetes cluster and how do I maintain it?

In this first lab, we'll go from absolute zero to having a bare Kubernetes installation. In [the next lab](/labs/lab2/overview.md), we'll prepare that cluster for production, and [in the third lab](/labs/lab3/overview.md) we'll use the cluster to deploy several generic and custom apps.
