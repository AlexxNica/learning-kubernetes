This a cutting edge solution for managing Kubernetes components from within Kubernetes itself. That means that if I wanted to bump the version of the Kubernetes API server, I'd simply edit a YAML file, commit the changes to git, which would trigger a `kubectl apply` via a CI system.

That would let us run a High-Availability Kubernetes cluster.
