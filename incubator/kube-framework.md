# Common commands (the thin imperative layer)

- Create cluster repository (with sane defaults)
- (Optional) Personalize before cluster creation
- Create infrastructure (cloud provider -level) + perform cluster configuration (kubernetes-level)
- Use external (public or private) charts to quickly configure and spin up Kubernetes apps (a.k.a. Helm Releases)
