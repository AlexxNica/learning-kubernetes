# Universal Control Plane -- Docker Enterprise Edition (EE)

<https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/ucp/2.2/guides/>

## Workflow Notes

It feels like a **web-based IDE for managing a Docker Swarm mode cluster**. An alternative workflow (that might actually feel more natural for developers) is this tool stack:

- Git (GitUp GUI)
- Atom (or any other text editor)
- Continous Integration Pipeline
- Monitoring GUI (no mutations of data)
